# Import the AppConfig class from the django.apps module

# The from django.apps import AppConfig line imports the AppConfig class from the django.apps module. AppConfig is a class provided by Django that allows you to configure the behavior of your app.

# The class StoreConfig(AppConfig): line defines a new configuration class named StoreConfig that extends the AppConfig class. This class will be used to configure the behavior of the store app.

# default_auto_field is a configuration option that specifies the default field type for automatically generated model IDs. In this case, 'django.db.models.BigAutoField' is used, which means that the app will use a large integer field for automatically generated IDs. This is suitable for databases that support big integers efficiently.

# name is a configuration option that sets the name of the app. In this case, it's set to 'store', which should match the name of the Django app (the directory containing the app's code).

# This StoreConfig class is a way to provide specific configuration settings for the store app within your Django project. It allows you to customize how certain aspects of the app behave, such as the default auto field for model IDs.
